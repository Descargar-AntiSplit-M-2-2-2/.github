## What is AntiSplit M?

**AntiSplit M** is a powerful tool that simplifies the process of merging split APK files into a single, usable APK. Unlike many other solutions available, such as Apktool M or AntiSplit G2, AntiSplit M is open-source and user-friendly. It addresses a significant flaw in split APK merging by removing split-related information from the AndroidManifest.xml file, ensuring smooth installation across different devices.

### Key Features of AntiSplit M:
- **Easy Merge Functionality**: Merge multiple APKs into one with just a few taps.
- **Material You Design**: A sleek, modern interface for Android 4.4+ devices.
- **Automatic Manifest Fixing**: Prevents the "App not installed" error by removing split-related entries in the manifest file.
- **Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with APKs/XAPKs/APKMs and supports Android versions as old as 1.6 (Version 1.x) and as recent as Android 13 (Version 2.x).

## Why Should You Use AntiSplit M?

Merging APK files is often complicated, with some tools being either too complex or closed-source, limiting user flexibility. **AntiSplit M** offers an open-source alternative with a simplified process. Notably, it fixes the AndroidManifest.xml issue automatically, making it far more reliable than other apps like AntiSplit G2, which leave this problem unresolved.

### Benefits of Using AntiSplit M:
- **Smooth Installation**: Ensures that merged APKs install correctly on all devices.
- **Lightweight and Fast**: The app is optimized for quick merging without consuming much device storage.
- **Free and Open-Source**: Unlike other tools that may require payments or hidden fees, AntiSplit M is completely free and open-source, giving you full control over your APK merging needs.

## How to Use AntiSplit M

Using **AntiSplit M** is straightforward. Here’s how you can start merging split APKs into a single APK:

1. **Open the App**: Launch AntiSplit M from your Android device’s app drawer.
2. **Select a Split APK**: You can either:
   - Share the APK file to the app via the share menu.
   - Open the APK file directly by selecting AntiSplit M in your file manager.
   - Use the built-in file picker to browse for the split APK.
3. **Merge the APKs**: After selecting the split APKs, simply follow the on-screen instructions to merge them into a single APK.

### Common Issues and Solutions:
- **APK Signature Problems**: Ensure that the APK is signed before installation. If you're modifying the APK further, signing is required after your changes.
- **File Compatibility**: If you’re unable to open an XAPK file, try renaming it to a ZIP file. If that doesn’t work, extract the ZIP and select the APKs inside.

## Why Choose AntiSplit M Over Other Apps?

While several other tools exist for merging APK files, **AntiSplit M** stands out in terms of its simplicity, reliability, and openness. Unlike AntiSplit G2, which doesn't remove split metadata from the manifest, AntiSplit M offers a fully integrated solution that prevents installation errors.

Moreover, **AntiSplit M** supports devices running Android 4.4+ (Version 2.x), while older devices (Android 1.6+ on Version 1.x) can still use its functions. The inclusion of Material You design ensures a modern, intuitive interface across devices.

## Permissions and Privacy

**AntiSplit M** requires a few permissions to work correctly:
- **Storage Permissions**: To save merged files in the appropriate directories.
- **QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES**: To list installed apps for APK selection.
- **REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES**: Allows direct installation of the merged APK.
- **Internet Permission**: Optional permission to check for app updates.

These permissions are necessary to ensure a smooth experience while using the app. You can also request a build without certain permissions if privacy is a concern.

## Conclusion

**AntiSplit M** is the perfect solution for anyone dealing with split APKs on Android. Its user-friendly interface, seamless merging process, and the ability to remove split-related data from the AndroidManifest.xml make it a must-have tool for APK management. Whether you're using a modern Android device or an older version, **AntiSplit M** delivers a hassle-free APK merging experience.
