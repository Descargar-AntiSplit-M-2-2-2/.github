    <p>Are you struggling with multiple split APKs and want a simple solution to merge them into a regular APK? <strong>AntiSplit M</strong> is the answer! This Android app allows you to effortlessly merge split APKs (APKS/XAPK/APKM) into a single, easy-to-install APK file, solving a problem that many users face with fragmented APK installations.</p>

    <h2>What is AntiSplit M?</h2>
    <p><strong>AntiSplit M</strong> is a powerful tool that simplifies the process of merging split APK files into a single, usable APK. Unlike many other solutions available, such as Apktool M or AntiSplit G2, AntiSplit M is open-source and user-friendly. It addresses a significant flaw in split APK merging by removing split-related information from the AndroidManifest.xml file, ensuring smooth installation across different devices.</p>

    <h3>Key Features of AntiSplit M:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Easy Merge Functionality</strong>: Merge multiple APKs into one with just a few taps.</li>
        <li><strong>Material You Design</strong>: A sleek, modern interface for Android 4.4+ devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Automatic Manifest Fixing</strong>: Prevents the "App not installed" error by removing split-related entries in the manifest file.</li>
        <li><strong>Compatibility</strong>: Works seamlessly with APKs/XAPKs/APKMs and supports Android versions as old as 1.6 (Version 1.x) and as recent as Android 13 (Version 2.x).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Should You Use AntiSplit M?</h2>
    <p>Merging APK files is often complicated, with some tools being either too complex or closed-source, limiting user flexibility. <strong>AntiSplit M</strong> offers an open-source alternative with a simplified process. Notably, it fixes the AndroidManifest.xml issue automatically, making it far more reliable than other apps like AntiSplit G2, which leave this problem unresolved.</p>

    <h3>Benefits of Using AntiSplit M:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Smooth Installation</strong>: Ensures that merged APKs install correctly on all devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Lightweight and Fast</strong>: The app is optimized for quick merging without consuming much device storage.</li>
        <li><strong>Free and Open-Source</strong>: Unlike other tools that may require payments or hidden fees, AntiSplit M is completely free and open-source, giving you full control over your APK merging needs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Use AntiSplit M</h2>
    <p>Using <strong>AntiSplit M</strong> is straightforward. Here’s how you can start merging split APKs into a single APK:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Open the App</strong>: Launch AntiSplit M from your Android device’s app drawer.</li>
        <li><strong>Select a Split APK</strong>: You can either:
            <ul>
                <li>Share the APK file to the app via the share menu.</li>
                <li>Open the APK file directly by selecting AntiSplit M in your file manager.</li>
                <li>Use the built-in file picker to browse for the split APK.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Merge the APKs</strong>: After selecting the split APKs, simply follow the on-screen instructions to merge them into a single APK.</li>
        <li><strong>Install the Merged APK</strong>: Once merged, you’ll have the option to install the new APK directly from the app.</li>
    </ol>


    <h3>Common Issues and Solutions:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>APK Signature Problems</strong>: Ensure that the APK is signed before installation. If you're modifying the APK further, signing is required after your changes.</li>
        <li><strong>File Compatibility</strong>: If you’re unable to open an XAPK file, try renaming it to a ZIP file. If that doesn’t work, extract the ZIP and select the APKs inside.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Choose AntiSplit M Over Other Apps?</h2>
    <p>While several other tools exist for merging APK files, <strong>AntiSplit M</strong> stands out in terms of its simplicity, reliability, and openness. Unlike AntiSplit G2, which doesn't remove split metadata from the manifest, AntiSplit M offers a fully integrated solution that prevents installation errors.</p>

    <p>Moreover, <strong>AntiSplit M</strong> supports devices running Android 4.4+ (Version 2.x), while older devices (Android 1.6+ on Version 1.x) can still use its functions. The inclusion of Material You design ensures a modern, intuitive interface across devices.</p>

    <h2>Permissions and Privacy</h2>
    <p><strong>AntiSplit M</strong> requires a few permissions to work correctly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Storage Permissions</strong>: To save merged files in the appropriate directories.</li>
        <li><strong>QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES</strong>: To list installed apps for APK selection.</li>
        <li><strong>REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES</strong>: Allows direct installation of the merged APK.</li>
        <li><strong>Internet Permission</strong>: Optional permission to check for app updates.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These permissions are necessary to ensure a smooth experience while using the app. You can also request a build without certain permissions if privacy is a concern.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p><strong>AntiSplit M</strong> is the perfect solution for anyone dealing with split APKs on Android. Its user-friendly interface, seamless merging process, and the ability to remove split-related data from the AndroidManifest.xml make it a must-have tool for APK management. Whether you're using a modern Android device or an older version, <strong>AntiSplit M</strong> delivers a hassle-free APK merging experience.</p>
